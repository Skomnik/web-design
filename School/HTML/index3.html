            "The Computing Science degree was not an educational path I originally looked for - it found me. After my first course in the Computing Science program, I never looked back.
            There are a variety of things that made my time at TRU worthwhile and helped me achieve my goals. There is a wide range of courses that involve not only technical understanding of course material, but applied learning as well."
